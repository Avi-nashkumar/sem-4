VIRUS from University of Dabra

Veeru Sahastra Buddhi aka VIRUS is an angry old professor from university of Dabra. In his class there are N students where a student male student is represented as 0 and female as 1. One day he calls his students to stand on a line. Since students randomly stood on a line along with their friends, all male and female students mixed together in the line L = [l1,l2,l3â€¦.lN] where li represents 0 or 1 based on male or female. Now VIRUS is very angry that students ae mixed in the line L. He wanted all the female students together in the line. At a time, VIRUS can swap any two students from the L. So now what is the minimum number of swaps X required to group the female students together. If L = {1, 0, 1, 0, 1} then X = 1. Only 1 swap is required to group all females together by swapping index 1 with 4 will give us a new sequence {1, 1, 1, 0, 0} If L = {1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1} then X=1.
