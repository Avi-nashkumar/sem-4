Ravindra Jadeja is a naughty CSE student in Bennett University. Jadeja one day he tried to peek into his roommate Rohit Sharmaâ€™s suitcase. The suitcase has security system with 4-digit numbers. When Jadeja was trying to open the suitcase, Rohit catches him. Jadeja then smiles like an innocent boy. Now Rohit says that Jadeja will allow him to have a look inside the suitcase if he can do the unlocking in the following way. Rohit will reveal the actual pin Y (prime number) and set the lock with 4 digit prime number X. Now Jadeja has to change only one digit of X at a time. The number he sets from X should be a prime number. Then one digit of that prime number can be changed where the next number should also be a prime number. In this way Jadeja has to change X into Y by changing one digit at a time where each number on the series should be a prime number. Since Jadeja is a lazy boy he was wondering that what is the minimum number of times Z he can do the iteration to convert a prime number X to prime number Y. 
If suppose X = 1033 and Y = 8179, then sequence is 1033, 1733, 3733, 3739, 3779, 8779, 8179. So the answer Z = 6. Similarly if X = 1373 and Y = 8017 then Z=7. If X=1033 and Y = 1033 then Z=0.
